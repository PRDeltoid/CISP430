# Algorithms and Data Types

**Algorithm:** Set of steps used to solve a problem

**Program:** The implimentation of algorithm using programming language

**Data Structures:** Organization of data in the computer/program

*Example:*
_Program Prompt:_ Find the highest number in a set of integer numbers

_Input Specs:_
"set of integer numbers": Array of ints
_Output Specs:_
"highest number": A single integer

Effecient algorithms are the main factor for a "good" algorithm. This is determine by the running time of the algo, and the space required for it.

Larger inputs TEND to effect the effeciency of the algorith, causing it to become slower/less effecient.
